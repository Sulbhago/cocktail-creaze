# Getting Started with Cocktail

This project was bootstrapped with [CocktailHaven](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Install dependencies/modules**

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

2. **Start the project**

    ```shell
     yarn start
    ```

If everything is correct your project will launch at http://localhost:3000/

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

 .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1. **`/public`**: This directory contains all of the static files to be served, required for the build

1. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

1. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

1. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
